            <h4>QC Express Terms and Conditions of Carriage</h4>
        <p>("Terms and Conditions")
        When ordering QC Express's services you, as "Shipper", are agreeing, on your behalf and on behalf of the consignee of the Shipment ("Consignee") and anyone else with an interest in the Shipment that these Terms and Conditions shall apply.
        </p>
        <p>"Shipment" means all documents or parcels that travel under one waybill and which may be carried by any means QC Express chooses, including air, road or any other carrier. A "waybill" shall include any Shipment identifier or document produced by QC Express or Shipper automated systems such as a label, barcode, waybill or consignment note as well as any electronic version thereof. Every Shipment is transported on a limited liability basis as provided herein. If Shipper requires greater protection, then insurance may be arranged at an additional cost. (Please see below for further information). "QC Express" means any member of the QC Express Network.
       
        </p>
        <h4> Customs Clearance and Regulatory Compliance	</h4> 	
  QC Express may perform any of the following activities on Shipper's or Consignee’s behalf in order to provide services: (1) complete any documents, amend product or service codes and advance any duties, taxes or other regulatory charges required under applicable laws and regulations ("Customs Duties"), (2) act as Shipper’s or Consignee's true and lawful agent or designate a customs broker to perform export control and customs clearance and (3) redirect the Shipment to Consignee's customs broker or other address upon request by any person who QC Express believes in its reasonable opinion to be authorized. Shipper or Consignee will provide any extra authorization required by applicable law for QC Express to clear a Shipment.
         <h4>Unacceptable Shipments	</h4>
         <p> A Shipment is deemed unacceptable if:
        it contains complete firearms, ammunition, explosives, explosive devices or test pieces, air guns, replica or imitation firearms; counterfeit goods; cash; bullion (of any precious metal); live animals, prohibited animal parts or remains, such as ivory; human remains or ashes; loose precious or semi-precious stones; cannabis or its derivatives; or illegal goods, such as narcotics or other illegal drugs,
        it is classified as hazardous material, dangerous goods, prohibited or restricted articles under ADR (European Road Transport Regulation on dangerous goods) or by IATA (International Air Transport Association), ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization), or other relevant organization ("Dangerous Goods"),
        it contains any other item which QC Express cannot carry safely or legally,
        the address is incorrect or not properly marked or its packaging is defective or inadequate to ensure safe transportation with ordinary care in handling,
        Shipper, Consignee or any other party with a direct or indirect interest in the Shipment is listed on any applicable sanctions lists as a denied or restricted party.
        </p>
         <h4>Deliveries and Undeliverables	</h4>
        Shipments cannot be delivered to PO boxes or postal codes. Shipments are delivered to the Consignee's address given by Shipper but not necessarily to the named Consignee personally. Shipments to addresses with a central receiving area will be delivered to that area.
      
        <p>
        QC Express may notify Consignee of an upcoming delivery or a missed delivery. Consignee may be offered alternative delivery options such as delivery on another day, no signature required, redirection or collection at a QC Express Service Point.
        </p>
        <p>
        If the Shipment is deemed to be unacceptable as described in Section 2, it has been undervalued for customs purposes, Consignee cannot be reasonably identified or located, or Consignee refuses delivery or to pay Customs Duties or other Shipment charges, QC Express shall use reasonable efforts to return the Shipment to Shipper. This shall be at Shipper's cost. If it is not possible to return the Shipment, it may be released, abandoned, disposed of or sold without incurring any liability whatsoever to Shipper or anyone else. QC Express shall have the right to destroy any Shipment if QC Express is prevented by any law or law enforcement agency from returning it in whole or in part to Shipper, as well as any Shipment of Dangerous Goods.
        
        <h4>Inspection</h4> 	
        QC Express has the right to open and inspect a Shipment without notice for safety, security, customs or other regulatory reasons.
        <h4>Shipment Charges, Duties and Fees	</h4> 
        QC Express's Shipment charges are calculated according to the higher of actual or volumetric weight per piece and any piece may be re-weighed and re-measured by QC Express to confirm this calculation.
       </p>

        Payment of Customs Duties and other charges due as indicated on QC Express's website in the receiving country may be requested from Consignee prior to delivery.
        
        This includes a fee if QC Express uses its credit with the Customs Authorities or pays any Customs Duties on Consignee's behalf. Shipper shall pay or reimburse QC Express for all Customs Duties and other charges due for services provided by QC Express or incurred by QC Express on Shipper's or Consignee's behalf if Consignee has failed to pay.
        
        <h4> QC Express's Liability	</h4>
         <p>QC Express's liability in respect of any one Shipment transported by air (including ancillary road transport or stops en route) is limited by the Montreal Convention or the Warsaw Convention as applicable, or in the absence of such Convention, to the lower of (i) the current market or declared value, or (ii) 22 Special Drawing Rights per kilogram (approximately $US 30.00 per kilogram). Such limits shall also apply to all other forms of transportation, except where Shipments are carried only by road, when the limits below apply.
        
        For cross border Shipments transported by road, QC Express's liability is or shall be deemed to be limited by the Convention for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (CMR) to the lower of (i) current market value or declared value, or (ii) 8.33 Special Drawing Rights per kilogram (approximately $US 11.00 per kilogram). Such limits will also apply to national road transportation in the absence of any mandatory or lower liability limits in the applicable national transport law.
        
        If Shipper regards these limits as insufficient it must make a special declaration of value and request insurance as described in Section 8 or make its own insurance arrangements.
        
        QC Express's liability is strictly limited to direct loss and damage to a Shipment only and to the per kilogram limits in this Section 6.

         QC Express will make every reasonable effort to deliver the Shipment according to QC Express's regular delivery schedules, but these schedules are not binding and do not form part of the contract. QC Express is not liable for any damages or loss caused by delay, but for certain Shipments, Shipper may be able to claim limited delay compensation under the Money Back Guarantee terms and conditions.

        <h4>Claims	</h4>
        All claims must be submitted in writing to QC Express within thirty (30) days from the date that QC Express accepted the Shipment, failing which QC Express shall have no liability whatsoever. Claims are limited to one claim per Shipment, settlement of which will be full and final settlement for all loss or damage in connection therewith.
         Shipment Insurance	
         Express may be able to arrange insurance for loss of or damage to the Shipment, covering the full value of the goods, provided that Shipper so instructs QC Express in writing, including by completing the insurance section of the waybill or using QC Express's automated systems and pays the applicable premium. Shipment insurance does not cover indirect loss or damage, or loss or damage caused by delays.
         Circumstances Beyond QC Express's Control
